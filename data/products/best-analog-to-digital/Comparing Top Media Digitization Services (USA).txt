Comparing Top Media Digitization Services (USA)
Independent Digitization Services
iMemories (Scottsdale, AZ)
•	Service Ratings & Badges: Established 2006, iMemories has served over a million customers. It holds a 4.5–4.6★ Trustpilot rating and an A+ BBB rating, indicating generally high customer satisfaction. (SiteJabber reviews are 4.7★, though some platforms like Amazon show lower scores.)
•	Pricing: Standard pricing is $29.99 per videotape (up to 2 hours) and $29.99 per 50 ft of film; photo scans are $0.99 each. iMemories often runs 50% off promotions (e.g. code “SAVE50” cuts those rates in half). Be aware: after conversion, physical media costs are extra – USB drives from $39.99 (8GB) and DVDs $19.99 each, and their cloud storage (optional) is a subscription ($7.99/mo or $49.99/yr). These add-ons make iMemories pricier for large projects.
•	Turnaround Time: Advertised ~2–3 weeks for digital copies, but in practice many customers report 4–6+ weeks during busy periods. iMemories provides tracking updates (“SafeShip” kit tracking and status emails) to keep you informed.
•	Supported Formats: Very broad format support: VHS, VHS-C, Betamax; 8mm/Hi8/Digital8; MiniDV/MicroMV camcorder tapes; 8mm, Super 8, 16mm film reels; plus 35mm slides, negatives, photo prints, and photo albums. (Notably, audio formats like cassettes/reels are not accepted.)
•	Key Features: Every order includes free cloud digital downloads of your files, and originals are returned at no charge. iMemories’ SafeShip Kit (waterproof, shock-resistant box) is provided for mailing your items securely. They offer a proprietary iMemories App/Cloud for instant viewing & sharing on smart devices and smart TVs. (Note: cloud access beyond a short free period requires a subscription).
•	Pros: Handles almost all common video/film/photo formats in one place. Long track record with no lost items reported in millions of items. Easy sharing via app and streaming. Good communication and a strong safety kit for shipping. Originals returned free.
•	Cons: Higher cost – especially for photos (no bulk discount, $0.99 each). Extra fees for output media and cloud storage. Turnaround can exceed estimates (many waited 6–8 weeks). Some users noted missing video segments or quality issues on old tapes. Does not convert audio tapes. Satisfaction guarantee policy is a bit vague. Overall, iMemories is convenient and high-tech, but be prepared for premium pricing and possible delays.
ScanMyPhotos (Irvine, CA)
•	Service Ratings & “Badges”: In business since 1990, ScanMyPhotos has preserved over 1 billion photos and garnered media praise (Today Show, WSJ, NY Times, Consumer Reports, etc.) for its speed and affordability. Customer reviews average around 4.2★ out of 5. They emphasize being a longstanding, trusted U.S.-based provider (all scanning done in-house in California).
•	Pricing: Best known for flat-rate bulk scanning. Their prepaid photo scanning box lets you fill a box with hundreds or thousands of prints for one flat fee (e.g. often around $145–$169 for ~1,800 photos, equating to ~$0.09 per photo). Standard à la carte rates are higher (e.g. ~$0.16–$0.39 per photo depending on resolution/services). For videos, they offer a VHS-to-Digital box up to 14 tapes for ~$27 per tape ( ~$375 total) or individual VHS transfers at ~$19.95 per tape. (They often run 50% off promotions, so costs can be lower.) Extra services like image restoration or video editing are available at additional cost.
•	Turnaround Time: Fast processing is a hallmark – they even offer same-day “ScanFast” service for urgent photo orders. Typical mail-in orders are turned around in about 7–14 days after receipt, often faster than big-box competitors. They pride themselves on quick completion – many customers note projects finishing ahead of schedule.
•	Supported Formats: Specialist in photo media: prints (all sizes), 35mm slides, negatives, photo albums, scrapbooks (scanned page by page). They also handle video tapes (VHS, VHS-C, Hi8) and small movie reels (Regular 8mm, Super 8, 16mm) via their transfer services. Limitations: Their prepaid VHS box accepts only VHS/VHS-C/Hi8 (no MiniDV or Betamax in the box), and generally they focus on consumer formats (no professional broadcast tapes).
•	Key Features: High-speed bulk scanning using industrial scanners – extremely efficient for large photo collections. They offer optional enhancements (like OCR for slides, color correction, etc.) for an extra fee. All scanning is done in the USA for security. They have a 100% satisfaction pledge and will re-scan if you’re unhappy. Notably, ScanMyPhotos has been featured by numerous reputable outlets, which serves as a badge of quality.
•	Pros: Cost-effective for bulk photos – among the lowest prices per photo when using their box deals. Very fast turnaround – a go-to for time-sensitive projects. Decades of experience and lots of positive press lend credibility. Everything stays stateside (no overseas shipping), and they handle your originals with care (manual handling, dust removal available).
•	Cons: Enhancement services cost extra – things like color correction or image rotation that some competitors include by default may require an upcharge. Limited video/film capabilities – they can convert common videotapes and 8mm film, but not as wide a range of formats as some others (e.g. Betamax or audio are not supported in standard offerings). The service is somewhat specialized to photos, so for diverse media collections you may need multiple services. Also, while photo scanning quality is good, extremely high DPI or professional-grade scanning might be better served by smaller specialty firms. Overall, ScanMyPhotos is ideal for quickly tackling huge photo piles at low cost, but is less focused on rare formats or heavy post-processing.
Forever Studios (Boca Raton, FL)
•	Service Ratings & Reputation: Founded in 2007, Forever Studios markets itself as a premium “white-glove” service for family history preservation[1][2]. They have served thousands of clients and boast high customer ratings (around 4.8–5★ on Google/Facebook). Notably, they emphasize being “America’s choice” with professional-grade quality; their team and services have been featured in local media in Florida. (Forever Studios directly contrasts itself with Legacybox in their marketing, claiming superior quality and customer care[3].)
•	Pricing: Competitive but often discounted. Standard videotape transfers are about $20 per tape (with frequent 50% off sales bringing it to ~$10)[4][5]. 8mm/Super8 film to digital runs about $25 per reel (assuming 3” reels)[5]. Loose photo scanning starts around $0.35 each for smaller prints[6]. They often advertise “50% off” deals (e.g. tapes for $12, photos $0.35 instead of $0.75)[6]. Unlike kit-based services, Forever Studios charges per item with no minimum, and they do not require upfront bulk package purchases. Also, no recurring fees – you get your digital files on USB or download without subscription. (They do have a $36 “Small Box” option for 2 items as a starter kit, which effectively is $18/item)[7].
•	Turnaround Time: Generally faster than big-box services – often 2–4 weeks for typical orders. They have in-house processing and even local drop-off at their studio (and several partner locations) which can save shipping time. Rush service is available for an extra fee. (They have noted 10–12 week times for certain large slide scanning projects in blog posts, but that is an outlier; most standard orders are completed within a few weeks.) They provide personal updates and you can speak directly to their staff for status.
•	Supported Formats: Very comprehensive: All consumer videotapes (VHS, VHS-C, Hi8, Video8, MiniDV, Betamax, etc.)[4], all common movie films (8mm, Super 8, 16mm – with or without sound), and all photo types (loose prints, album pages, 35mm slides, negatives). They also handle audio (cassettes, vinyl, reel-to-reel) – a feature many competitors lack. Additionally, they offer photo restoration services and can create custom prints/wall-art from your images[8][9]. This one-stop capability for tapes, films, photos and audio is a strong point.
•	Key Features: Quality focus: Forever Studios uses professional-grade scanners and upscaling equipment. Uniquely, they apply AI-based enhancements to videos by request – e.g. their proprietary upscaling to HD and noise reduction for old videos[10][11]. They offer personal consultations – you can talk to an expert to tailor your project (useful if you have fragile items or special requests). For local customers in South Florida, they even do in-home pickup and drop-off. They also provide 60 days free cloud storage for downloads and offer a “Forever Cloud” archival option for long-term access.
•	Pros: High-quality output – known for careful handling and superior image quality (many prosumer clients use them)[12][13]. They include enhancements (color correction on photos, basic editing) at no extra cost, aiming for “museum grade” results. Personalized service: it’s easy to reach a human, and every project gets a one-on-one review to match customer needs. They support virtually all formats (including audio and odd video formats that kit services often refuse). No large upfront kit purchase required – you pay for what you actually send. Often faster than the big mail-in competitors on equivalent orders.
•	Cons: Higher price point – while competitive when on sale, their regular pricing per item is still on the premium side (e.g. ~$0.84 per photo scan before volume discounts, a $50 base service fee on orders, etc.)[14][15]. If you have huge quantities and don’t need the extra service level, it could be more expensive than a DIY bulk service. Some customers have noted the pricing process can be complex for large, mixed-media orders (lots of custom options can lead to confusion or changing estimates)[16]. They are based in Florida – if you’re not local, you still have to ship items (though they have partner drop-offs in some cities). In summary, Forever Studios is ideal for those who prioritize quality and personal care and are willing to invest a bit more for it.
Legacybox (Chattanooga, TN)
•	Service Ratings & Notability: Legacybox (founded 2013) is one of the most well-known digitization services, having served over 1 million families across the U.S.[17]. It’s heavily advertised and has an A- BBB rating. Customer review averages are more mixed – roughly 3.5★ out of 5 overall (some high praise for convenience, tempered by complaints about speed). Legacybox’s “badge” is its brand recognition: it’s often featured in TV/radio ads and was an Editor’s Pick in some buyer’s guides due to its all-in-one simplicity.
•	Pricing: Uses a kit-based (bulk) pricing model. You purchase a box size by number of items: e.g. 2-item Starter kit for about $69.99 (often discounted to ~$34.99)[18], 10-item Family kit around $159.99, 20-item Closet kit ~$319.99, and up to a 40-item Trunk kit around $599[18]. (One “item” = 1 tape, 1 film reel, or 25 photos). These list prices frequently go on sale (50% off is common). Example: during a sale, the 10-item box might effectively cost ~$150 (i.e. ~$15 per item). Shipping of the kit to you is free; return shipping of your originals costs an additional ~$9.95 flat[19]. Included in the price: digitization of each item and a set of output media (typically a downloadable link or DVD). Extra copies (USB drives, additional DVD sets) cost extra at checkout.
•	Turnaround Time: Slow. Officially they quote 6–8 weeks average[20], but many customers have experienced 10–12 weeks or even several months for completion[21][22], especially during peak seasons or big promotions. Legacybox operates at very high volume, which can lead to backlogs. They do offer a “fast processing” upgrade for a fee, which can cut the line (e.g. a “priority” add-on). If timing matters, this is something to consider, as standard orders can take a while.
•	Supported Formats: Wide range: All common videotapes (VHS, VHS-C, 8mm/Hi8/Digital8, MiniDV, Betamax, MicroMV, PAL tapes)[23][24], movie films (8mm, Super 8, 16mm), prints, slides, negatives, and also audio cassettes & reel-to-reel audio. Essentially any consumer analog media is accepted. This comprehensive format support is a strength – you can send old audio reels and they count as “items” in your kit just like videos or photos.
•	Key Features: The all-in-one kit convenience is Legacybox’s selling point – they send a sturdy, barcoded box with tracking labels for each item, so everything is tracked through the process[25][26]. They send email updates at each stage (kit received, scanning, order completed). Digital output options include downloads, DVDs or a thumb drive (30-day cloud download is usually free; physical media costs extra). Legacybox provides $1,000 loss protection per kit and will reimburse media value if they lost/damaged (rare, but a peace of mind factor). The service has been highlighted by outlets like USA Today (which gave a positive nod)[27].
•	Pros: Very easy process – just pack your items and send; no need to count hours or worry about format-specific pricing[28][29]. Good format coverage, so one kit handles tapes, films, photos together[23][24]. Trusted brand with a large customer base and long track record. Included return of originals and choice of output media make it convenient for non-tech-savvy folks. Frequent discounts make the per-item cost attractive (often <$20 each on sale, which is competitive given they handle everything end-to-end).
•	Cons: Long turnaround – often the biggest complaint (waiting 2–3+ months is not unusual)[21][22]. Communication issues – while they do send updates, some customers felt customer support was slow or unhelpful during delays[30]. There can be hidden costs: e.g. if you send more items than your kit covers, you’ll be charged for the overages; extra copies (USB, more DVDs) are additional. Also, no manual image enhancements – it’s more of a mass-processing “assembly line” (no color correction or editing included). A small number of customers have reported lost or misplaced items (Legacybox/Southtree claims these are extremely rare, but there are a few serious complaints in reviews)[31][32]. In summary, Legacybox is great for simplicity and one-stop handling of large mixed-media orders, but you trade off speed and some personalized care for that convenience.
Memory Fortress (Duluth, GA)
•	Service Ratings & Overview: An Atlanta-based digitization company catering especially to large-volume orders. Memory Fortress has been operating since 2015, and maintains a stellar customer satisfaction record – 4.9★ average on Google reviews[33]. They position themselves as a bulk specialist with a focus on speed, low cost, and U.S.-only handling. Unlike many mail-in services, they pride themselves on a personal touch (real people on the phone) and not being a “prepaid box factory” (in fact, they openly criticize boxed kit competitors as “scams” in their FAQ)[34][35].
•	Pricing: Extremely transparent and affordable, especially for big orders. There is no upfront kit fee – instead you pay per item with volume discounts. For example, video tapes are $20 each for 1–3 tapes, dropping to $15 each by 51+ tapes (with tiers in between)[36][37].  (They do have a $99 minimum order, but that’s easy to hit with a few items)[38]. Photo scanning averages about $0.35 per loose photo (and ~$0.50 per album photo) – and they include things like color correction, rotation, cropping in that price[39][40]. They offer generous volume discounts (10–30%) if you send large quantities[41]. Importantly, all extras are included – e.g. organizing files into folders, custom file naming, basic image enhancement are built-in to the price[40]. There’s no charge per GB or per DVD either; return media (DVDs, USBs, or download links) are provided at cost (USBs ~$15–20 or free cloud download). Shipping: You pay to ship items in, but return shipping is free for orders over $99[42].
•	Turnaround Time: Very fast. Memory Fortress is designed for high throughput – most orders are completed in 5 business days or less (larger orders might take 10 business days)[43]. They even state that they strive for 1–2 day turnaround on small orders[43]. This is significantly faster than industry norms. Of course, shipping time to/from Georgia adds a bit, but many customers are amazed at getting their digital files back within a week or two of sending in. They also back up your files for free (temporarily) on their servers until you confirm receipt – an extra safety net[44].
•	Supported Formats: Almost everything: VHS, VHS-C, Hi8/Digital8, MiniDV, Betamax, etc., all converted to DVD or MP4 files[45][46]. All consumer film reels (8mm, Super 8, 16mm) at $0.29/foot[47]. 35mm slides, negatives, prints, scrapbooks – they handle them all (and will scan entire scrapbook pages). They do not require you to sort or count things into sets – they’ll figure it out and charge based on final counts. One caveat: while they convert audio tapes (mentioned on their site’s blog), their main pages emphasize video/film/photo; it’s likely they will do audio cassettes or reels if asked, but it’s not a core offering advertised.
•	Key Features: Full editing included – every photo is auto/color-corrected, rotated, cropped, and sharpened by default[40]. They create a logical folder structure for your files (e.g. by media type or labeling you provide) and can even customize filenames – useful when dealing with thousands of images[48]. High capacity: They welcome huge orders (they’ve done orders of 100,000+ photos and 100+ tapes)[49]. They will even arrange pickup for very large orders in some cases (they’ve “sent trucks out of state” for million-photo jobs)[50]. No forced bundles: You don’t have to buy a fixed box – you send exactly what you want digitized and pay per piece, which can be more economical. Also notable: free backup – they keep a backup of your files until you confirm you have everything, so if something gets lost in transit or a drive fails, they can resend without charge[51].
•	Pros: Best bang for buck for large projects – prices are often half of big competitors for the same or better quality[39][52]. Super-fast turnaround – often ~1 week total, which is a relief if you’re on a deadline[43]. They include many “extras” (color fixes, organization) that others charge for[40]. Personal customer service: If you call, you’ll speak to a knowledgeable staff member right away[41]. Everything is done in-house in Georgia by a dedicated team (no outsourcing). Also, no surprises billing – you pay a $29 deposit and the rest after work is done[38].
•	Cons: No glossy marketing or fancy online portal – their process is a bit old-school (PDF order form or phone consultation to finalize orders). The user interface isn’t as slick as, say, iMemories’ app. No “kit” convenience – you have to pack your items yourself (they don’t send a shipping kit or prepaid label unless you request and pay for it). They strongly prefer customers handle shipping logistics. Additionally, if you enjoy doing your own organizing or want a custom approach, Memory Fortress’s thorough handling might overlap with what you’ve done (though you can opt out of services). Finally, they are less known nationally, so some people might hesitate to mail priceless items to a smaller company – but their track record is excellent. Overall, Memory Fortress is ideal if you have bulk media to digitize on a budget and want it done quickly, with lots of personal care included[39][53].
DigMyPics “MemoryBox” (Gilbert, AZ)
•	Service Ratings & Background: DigMyPics (est. 2002) is a veteran digitization service known for high-quality scanning and transfers. Their “MemoryBox” service is essentially a mail-in program similar to Legacybox, but with DigMyPics’ quality focus. Customer ratings are superb – about 4.9★ average (DigMyPics has a loyal following of photography enthusiasts). They’ve served over 100,000 families and scanned millions of images to date. DigMyPics is often recommended by professional photographers for slide scanning due to their careful work.
•	Pricing: Pay-per-item with enhancements included. For photo scanning, standard 300 DPI scans are around $0.49 each (higher for specialty slides or higher DPI)[54]. For example, 35mm slides are listed at ~$0.49/scan (bulk discounts may apply)[54]. Videotape transfers run about $19.99 per tape for up to 2 hours (this includes a digital file output)[55]. They also transfer film reels at ~$0.20–$0.25/foot. One standout: they don’t charge until after scanning, and they even allow you to review your images online and discard any scans you don’t want to keep (you then don’t pay for those) – a unique “pay for what you like” model for photos. There are no subscription fees; you get digital files via download, DVD or USB (reasonable media fees like $14.95 for a USB)[56][57]. Overall, DigMyPics isn’t the cheapest upfront, but value is high given the included services.
•	Turnaround Time: Typically 1.5–3 weeks depending on project size. DigMyPics is smaller scale than Legacybox, so they usually start on your project quickly. They post estimated turnaround on their site (e.g. 7–10 business days for a batch of photos or videos)[58][59]. Importantly, they offer real-time tracking – you can actually watch your images being scanned via an online interface (for photo orders), and see progress updates. This transparency is a big plus. Large orders (hundreds of slides or many tapes) might take a bit longer, but generally they stick to their quoted time frames.
•	Supported Formats: All common formats plus some niche ones. Photos: prints, slides (35mm, 126, 127, etc.), negatives of various sizes – all handled with professional equipment. Videos: VHS, VHS-C, 8mm/Hi8/Digital8, MiniDV, Betamax, MicroMV, etc. Film reels: 8mm, Super 8, 16mm (they do frame-by-frame scanning for quality). Audio: they convert audio cassettes and 1/4” reel tapes as well. In short, if you have a mix of old media, DigMyPics can likely handle it (their motto: “virtually all photo, video, and audio formats”).
•	Key Features: Professional quality control – every image is scanned and then manually reviewed by a technician for color correction and cropping (included in price)[40]. For slides/negatives, they perform dust and scratch removal. DigMyPics is known for its enhancement services – e.g. slide scans get color correction and exposure adjustment automatically, which many services skip. They also offer a cool feature: after scanning, they present your photos in a private web gallery so you can delete any you don’t want – you won’t be charged for those, and they won’t be included in final output (great if some slides turned out blurry or were duplicates). This ensures you pay only for the best results. Additionally, DigMyPics provides personal tech support – you can call and talk to the team actually doing the work.
•	Pros: Top-notch quality – DigMyPics is often cited for better color accuracy and detail retention, especially on slides and film, compared to mass-market services. All-inclusive service – price includes enhancements like color correction, so no surprise add-on fees. The ability to preview and omit unwanted scans is a customer-favorite that maximizes value. They have 20+ years of experience and it shows in careful handling of delicate media (people entrust them with priceless archival photos). Turnaround is reasonably quick and you can monitor progress online, giving peace of mind. Also, unlike Legacybox, they handle each item individually (no batch ambiguity), so fewer errors/mislabels occur.
•	Cons: Slightly higher base cost per item than some bulk services (you’re paying for the extra care). If you have thousands of photos that you just want scanned cheaply without corrections, DigMyPics might be overkill in terms of cost – a budget service could be cheaper (though lower quality). Because they are smaller, large orders can still take a few weeks, so it’s not overnight (but still generally faster than Legacybox’s months). Another consideration: MemoryBox vs. ScanMyPhotos naming confusion – DigMyPics brands their kit as “MemoryBox,” which is distinct from ScanMyPhotos’ prepaid box, though they serve similar purposes. Just be sure you’re ordering from the right website. Overall, DigMyPics MemoryBox is an excellent choice for those who want superior quality scans and are willing to pay a bit more for it, especially for precious photographs, slides and films that deserve expert attention.
Retail Partner Services
Walgreens Photo (Mail-Out Service by iMemories)
•	Overview: Walgreens offers digitization through its Photo department as a convenience to customers, but the actual work is handled by iMemories (Walgreens partners with iMemories and sends your media to iMemories’ lab in Arizona)[60][61]. This means you can drop off tapes or film at a local Walgreens, and after processing, pick up your originals and DVDs there. It’s a handy option if you prefer not to ship items yourself.
•	Pricing: Walgreens’ pricing is slightly higher than ordering directly from iMemories. For example: Videotapes are $34.99 each (to DVD)[62]; movie film reels start at $29.99 per 50 feet; and photo scanning to USB is $29.99 for a set of 30 prints (minimum)[62][63]. These prices often do not get the online “50% off” sales that iMemories.com runs. Also, Walgreens outputs videos only to DVD (no USB or digital download for tapes via Walgreens) – their FAQ notes that at this time VHS/video transfers go to DVD only[64][65]. So if you want MP4 files or cloud access, you’d have to rip the DVD or separately use iMemories’ app (Walgreens provides a code to access the iMemories cloud for 90 days, but ongoing cloud storage would cost extra).
•	Process & Turnaround: You bring your items to a Walgreens store (Photo counter). They will collect your media and send them to iMemories for processing. The turnaround is roughly 3–5 weeks (Walgreens itself cites ~3 weeks, but iMemories may take longer depending on volume). Add a few days for shipping from store to lab and back. You’ll receive an email or call when your DVDs are ready for pickup at the store. The advantage here is no need to package/ship yourself – Walgreens handles shipping (usually via FedEx) and the cost of that is built into the price.
•	Supported Formats: Same as iMemories – VHS, VHS-C, Hi8, Video8, MiniDV, Betamax, etc., plus 8mm/Super8/16mm film, and photo prints, negatives, slides[66][67]. Basically any format listed on iMemories’ site is accepted through Walgreens. Do note Walgreens will not take commercial copyrighted tapes (no Hollywood movies) and will return those unconverted (this is standard).
•	Key Features: Local convenience – the biggest draw is you can drop off and pick up locally, avoiding the anxiety of shipping yourself. Walgreens provides a tracking code for your order. You pay in-store, and any customer service issues can be initially addressed at the store (though complex issues might get referred to iMemories customer support). Walgreens often runs promotions in-store (e.g. 50% off digitization in January, etc.), so look out for Walgreens coupons that might align with your project.
•	Pros: Easy and accessible – thousands of Walgreens locations offer this, making it one of the most accessible ways to digitize without mailing. Trusted retail brand – some feel more secure handing items to a known pharmacy/photo center than shipping to an unknown address. You get professional quality results since iMemories does the work (with all their experience and equipment). Also, if you have a mix of media (tapes, films, photos), Walgreens will accept it all in one order.
•	Cons: Higher cost per item than other options – you’re essentially paying a premium for the convenience and retail handling (e.g. $34.99 per VHS via Walgreens vs $14.99 if you caught an iMemories sale online)[62]. Limited output options – the service is DVD-centric for videos, which is less convenient if you want digital files (you may have to rip the DVD or pay extra to iMemories for cloud/USB after the fact). Turnaround, while decent, can be a bit longer than sending direct (time is added for store handling). Lastly, any advanced features of iMemories (like their app editing or cloud sharing) might not be fully utilized with a Walgreens order, since it’s geared to a simple DVD delivery. In summary, Walgreens’ digitization is great if you want minimal hassle and local service, and are willing to pay a bit more for it.
“MemoryBox” by ScanMyPhotos/DigMyPics
•	Overview: MemoryBox is a term used for prepaid digitizing box services. Notably, DigMyPics markets its service under the name “MemoryBox,” and ScanMyPhotos offers a similar prepaid box for bulk scanning (sometimes also informally called a memory box)[68][69]. The concept: you get an empty box, fill it with photos or tapes, and the service digitizes everything inside. We’ll focus on DigMyPics’ MemoryBox here, as it’s a well-documented offering. DigMyPics MemoryBox has an excellent reputation (essentially it’s the same team and quality described in DigMyPics above). It was even rated the “#1 Legacybox alternative” in 2024.
•	Service Ratings & Experience: DigMyPics MemoryBox benefits from 20+ years of experience (since 2002) and a 4.9★ average rating from customers. It’s often praised for better quality and faster service than Legacybox. For example, MemoryBox is cited at 15–20 day turnaround vs Legacybox’s months, and a near perfect customer satisfaction score. This “badge” of being a long-standing family-run operation resonates with customers looking for an alternative to big brands.
•	Pricing: You choose a box size by the number of items, similar to Legacybox, or you can go item-by-item. The MemoryBox packages often come at a flat rate per item around $15–$20, with all enhancements included (exact pricing is usually provided on their site or via a quote). For instance, a small MemoryBox for 2 videotapes might be around $40–$50. What’s noteworthy: MemoryBox includes extras like image color correction for photos and scene-by-scene adjustment for films at no additional fee. There are no hidden fees – you won’t be charged later for a digital download or anything; all output (DVD/USB or downloads) can be selected upfront. Overall, MemoryBox pricing is competitive – not the rock-bottom cheapest, but considering the quality, it’s a good value.
•	Turnaround Time: Quicker than most kits. MemoryBox orders are typically completed in about 2–3 weeks (15–20 days as noted in comparisons). This is much faster than Legacybox’s average. DigMyPics achieves this by processing orders in-house and not overbooking beyond capacity. Plus, they keep you informed – you can track progress online, seeing statuses like “scanning in progress” for each item.
•	Supported Formats: Identical to DigMyPics core service – all common video, film, photo, and audio formats are accepted[70][71]. There’s no restriction on media type mixing: you can put tapes, films, photos all in one MemoryBox. The service advertises “all formats accepted” – from VHS to MiniDV, 8mm film to slides, even audio – which is broader than some kits that exclude audio.
•	Key Features: All-Inclusive Quality – MemoryBox’s big selling point is that unlike some competitors, they include things like professional color correction, dust removal, and image enhancement by default. Your photos and videos get individual attention. Also, MemoryBox provides real-time scanning previews – for example, as they scan your photos, you might get to peek at them online (few services offer this level of transparency). Secure handling – each item you send is barcoded and tracked (just like Legacybox) to ensure nothing gets lost, and being a smaller operation, they have a hands-on chain of custody.
•	Pros: High-end results for a flat-kit price. Many reviews note that MemoryBox (DigMyPics) delivered better image quality and color on scans and transfers compared to big-box services. Faster turnaround than Legacybox and its clones. Real customer support – if you call, you speak to the technicians, and issues (if any) are addressed quickly. No upsells or surprises – the price you pay covers everything needed for great results (no “oh pay extra for color correction” nonsense). They also offer a satisfaction guarantee – if you’re not happy, they’ll work to fix it. Overall, MemoryBox provides professional lab-quality digitizing with the convenience of a mailed kit.
•	Cons: Availability and ordering – You have to order MemoryBox through DigMyPics (online or phone); it’s not as ubiquitous as Legacybox retail kits. Because it’s popular among those “in the know”, there can occasionally be a waitlist during peak seasons (they won’t take your money and then delay; they might instead pause new orders – which is good, but means you need to catch them when slots are open). Cost for small orders – If you only have a couple of tapes, MemoryBox might not save you much money over competitors; its real value shines in medium to large orders where the included extras would have cost a lot elsewhere. Lastly, the name “MemoryBox” has caused a bit of confusion (as people sometimes mix it up with other services’ offerings), but as long as you go through DigMyPics, you’re in the right place. In summary, MemoryBox is an excellent premium-kit option for those who want to “set it and forget it” but still get top-quality results.

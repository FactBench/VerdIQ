# Solution for API Token Limit Error

## Problem
When trying to generate large HTML updates (all 11 products at once), Claude's response exceeds the 32,000 output token maximum.

## Best Solution: Script-Based Generation

### 1. Create a Node.js Script
Instead of generating HTML directly in Claude, we created a script that:
- Reads the `products-data.json` file
- Generates HTML programmatically
- Saves output to a separate file
- Can be reused for future updates

### 2. Benefits of This Approach
- **No token limits**: Script generates any amount of HTML
- **Reusable**: Run the script anytime you update products
- **Consistent**: Ensures all products use the same template
- **Version controlled**: Script can be saved in the project

### 3. Implementation Steps
1. Created `generate-products-html.js` script
2. Script reads data from `products-data.json`
3. Generates complete HTML section with all 11 products
4. Saves to `products-section.html`
5. Use MultiEdit to replace old section with new HTML

### 4. How to Use
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x generate-products-html.js

# Run the script
node generate-products-html.js

# Output will be in products-section.html
```

### 5. Next Steps
1. Open the generated `products-section.html`
2. Copy the entire content
3. Use MultiEdit tool to replace lines 162-2542 in `best-robotic-pool-cleaners.html`
4. Test the implementation
5. Deploy when ready

## Alternative Solutions (Not Recommended)

### Option 2: Batch Processing
- Generate 3-4 products at a time
- Use multiple MultiEdit calls
- More complex and error-prone

### Option 3: Incremental Updates
- Update one product at a time
- Very time-consuming
- Risk of inconsistencies

### Option 4: External Editor
- Copy HTML to external editor
- Make changes manually
- Loses automation benefits

## Why Script Solution is Best
1. **Scalable**: Works for any number of products
2. **Maintainable**: Easy to update template in one place
3. **Efficient**: Generates all HTML in seconds
4. **No API limits**: Bypasses token restrictions
5. **Testable**: Can preview HTML before applying

## Conclusion
The script-based approach is the most efficient and reliable solution for handling large HTML generation tasks that exceed API token limits.

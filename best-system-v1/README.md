# Best System V1 - Systematic Product Page Builder

## Overview
This system provides a step-by-step approach to building comprehensive product review pages by extracting and implementing data from source websites.

## System Structure

### Step 1 - Intro Section ✅
Establishes the foundation with basic intro elements:
- Title (H1)
- Subtitle (H2) 
- Last Updated Date
- Commission Disclaimer
- Basic Page Template

**Status**: Completed
**Documentation**: `step1-intro/STEP1-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Step 2 - [To Be Defined]
*Awaiting master instructions*

### Step 3 - [To Be Defined]
*Awaiting master instructions*

### Step 4 - [To Be Defined]
*Awaiting master instructions*

### Step 5 - [To Be Defined]
*Awaiting master instructions*

## Working Principle

1. **Master Approval Required**: Each step must be approved before execution
2. **Systematic Approach**: Build pages piece by piece, not all at once
3. **Documentation**: Each step has its own folder with instructions and reports
4. **Quality Control**: Test locally before deploying to live site

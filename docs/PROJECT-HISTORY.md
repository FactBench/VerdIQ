# FactBench Project History

## Session Log - July 31, 2025

### Morning Session (Initial Setup)
- Created initial FactBench project structure
- Built static site generator with Node.js
- Implemented dark theme with TailwindCSS
- Created pool cleaners review page with 3 products initially
- Set up GitHub Pages deployment

### Afternoon Session (Multi-Agent System & Enhancements)

#### 1. Documentation Phase
**User Request**: "dokumentiraj nas proces sto radi do sada"
- Created comprehensive README.md
- Created CLAUDE.md with AI assistant instructions
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md
- Created CHANGELOG.md
- Added architecture and deployment guides

#### 2. Multi-Agent System Development
**User Request**: Create agents for data extraction

Created Python-based multi-agent system:
- `ImageExtractorAgent` - Downloads product images
- `TextExtractorAgent` - Extracts text content
- `TableExtractorAgent` - Extracts table data
- `ReviewExtractorAgent` - Extracts reviews
- `ValidationAgent` - Validates data quality
- `DeploymentAgent` - Handles deployment
- `run_all_agents.py` - Orchestrator script

#### 3. Claude Code Agent Integration
**User Confusion**: Expected agents to appear with `/agents` command

Resolution:
- Explained difference between MCP agents and local scripts
- Created 7 Claude Code agents in `.claude/agents/`:
  - factbench-extractor (orchestrator)
  - image-downloader-organizer
  - text-extractor
  - table-extractor
  - review-extractor
  - validation-agent
  - deployment-agent

#### 4. Data Extraction & Site Enhancement
**User Request**: "pokreni sve te agente i prodi zoopy str ponovo"

Actions taken:
- Ran factbench-extractor agent on zoopy.com/best-robotic-pool-cleaners

- Updated product data with correct names and ratings:
  - Fixed "Polaris VRX iQ+" → "Polaris PCX 868 iQ"
  - Updated user ratings (1,000+, 17,000+, etc.)
  - Added missing products (BeatBot Ultra, WYBOT C2, etc.)

#### 5. Individual Review Pages

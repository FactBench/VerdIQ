   - Video review references
   - Pros and cons summaries
   - Verdict or conclusion sections

3. **Identify Review Sources**:

5. **Organize Review Data**:
   ```json
   {
     "product_id": "product-identifier",
     "summary": {
       "overall_rating": 4.5,
       "total_reviews": "17,000+",
       "rating_distribution": {
         "5": 70,
         "4": 20,
         "3": 5,
         "2": 3,
         "1": 2
       }
     },
     "expert_review": {
       "content": "Detailed review text",
       "pros": ["Pro 1", "Pro 2"],
       "cons": ["Con 1"],
       "verdict": "Recommended"
     },
     "user_reviews": [],
     "review_links": [
       {
         "url": "https://...",
         "text": "Read 17,000+ reviews",
         "type": "external"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

6. **Link Extraction Strategy**:
   - Find all "Read Reviews" buttons/links
